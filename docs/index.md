# Welcome!

_Welcome to the handbook of the Microfluidics 101 project! A repository for concepts, applications, and resources about Microfluidics._

_The Microfluidics 101 project_ seeks to be an open science, open collaboration, and community-driven project. Our goal is to provide all the information that students, professors, researchers, and other practitioners in academia need to ensure that they start with their projects and that they are easy to reproduce and reuse.
